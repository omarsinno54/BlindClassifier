# 👨🏽‍🦯‍➡️ BlindClassifier 

This is a quickly setup project off an idea I had around midnight my time, to use an available LLM to classify objects.

In this example project I use "GPT-4o" to classify objects, it is already doing a better job at classifying objects than most multiclass models trained.

Stay tuned for a better organiztaion of this repo!
